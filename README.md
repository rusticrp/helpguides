# RP Terminology

We understand that sometimes some terminology can be confusing for new players (and seasoned players sometimes) so we have put together this document to help you through the world of RP. These phrases help with RP and to stop the breaking of immersion for other citizens.

***

* <mark style="color:purple;">**Cousin:**</mark> A players 2nd/extra character. All characters a player has are their own entities and know nothing of each other (apart from their name and age if roleplaying as their sister/family member) Anything found out in one character cannot be used by another character.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Locals:**</mark> Those pesky NPC's and NPC cars you see around city.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Voicebox:**</mark> This is used in place of "microphone". I.e if someone has a problem with their mic (too quiet, too loud) you could say "Your voicebox is loud today"
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Threat Level:**</mark> Refers to current threat within the city. You will recieve an in city email should the threat level change which will give you details of the threat level.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Storm/Hurricane/Tsunami:**</mark> Refers to a server restart, this could be a scheduled restart or and unscheuled restart. Scheduled restarts occur at (all GMT) 15:00pm, 00:00am and 06:00am.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Prayer:**</mark> Opening a ticket on Discord.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**God:**</mark> Refers to the server owner (Ashton)
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Code 4:**</mark> This means a scene is over. It can be used to inform EMS/Fire that a scene is complete and they can carry out their jobs.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Flying in:**</mark> Means a citizen is joining the server
* <mark style="color:purple;">**City:**</mark> Refers to the world in which you play FiveM, you will most likely hear people say "im flying out of city" meaning they are exiting the game.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Permadeath / Perma:**</mark> If someone perma's a characer it means that they are getting rid of that character and will not be able to fly back in as that character in the future.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Emails:**</mark> Sending a DM in Discord or other OOC method
* <mark style="color:purple;">**OOC/IC:**</mark> Out of character and in character. OOC is used in out of city chats etc and OOC things cannot be taken into city. IC is stuff that happens in city, anything said IC can be used within the city if your character is aware of it. They have to have learnt of the info in city/character.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Bubble:**</mark> Sometimes players will get issues where their collision hitboxes seem alot larger than the model, this could be your character or a vehicle. Unfortunetly this can happen and re-fly normally fixes this.&#x20;
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Re-Fly:**</mark> Logging out and back into the city.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Head/brain:**</mark> Refers to a players physical PC. If your game crashes you could say "My head popped".  When someones says they are in their "head" it means they are doing something OOC/IRL.

* <mark style="color:purple;">**Combat log:**</mark> This is mainly covered by the rules, however, this means logging out during an active scene. Normally via an F8 quit/disconnect. Doing this is against the rules and ruins the RP experience for everyone involved.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Angels:**</mark> Used to describe the servers management/admin/support team. "I'm opening a prayer with the angels" would mean logging a ticket with support.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Bahamas/Vaction:**</mark> When a player is banned they are seen to be on "vacation". "Oh yeah they are on vacation for a week". If a player is perma banned then they have been sent to the Bahamas "Yeah they were sent to the Bahamas"

* <mark style="color:purple;">**Flex \[KEY] Muscle / Think about \[command]:**</mark> Tells players different controls to use in game. "How do I give someone keys", "Flex you T muscle and think about /givekeys"

* <mark style="color:purple;">**Eyes:**</mark> What a player can see on their screen at the time. Can be used to explain a few different scenarios, i.e "In my eyes I cant see that" (describing something they cant see but other players can), "In my eyes you are not moving" (describes to a player they may be crashing).
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Spider:**</mark> When the animation of your character has broken and is bugged for other players, can be used alongside "scuffed". Normal fix for this is to jump, press x, or refly.

  Shotguns, automatic pistols, SMGs and High caliber pistols - Class 2\
