# Boosting

## RusticRP Boosting

RusticRP is setup to use [Rahe's Boosting System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWOLQZB4cj4) within the city.

This means that all players whilst IC will have access to the boosting tablet by flexing t and thinking `/boosting`.

### Layout

Within the boosting table, there are a few different tabs.

#### Home

This is the home page of the boosting tablet, and the primary place where one will pickup boosting jobs, create & join boosting groups, and start the boosting jobs themselves.

#### Store

This will be fully functional in a future update to the city. Currently the items listed for sale are untested and not working. **DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THE STORE AT THIS TIME**.

In the future, the items listed in the shop will work. As well, the SCoin being earned will be able to be spent on vin scratches, which is a special type of boosting contract that allows the player to keep the car as a personal car as the end of the contract!

#### History

See the recent boosting contracts you've done.

#### Leaderboard

Public display of everyone's boosting level in terms of number of contracts completed, the number of experience earned, and the time last seen boosting.

#### User Profile

Set you underground boosting alias here. By default you will start with one similar to `User #####` but this can be changed to anything of your liking. We would advise using an underground alias, and not your IC name.

## How it works

1. Join the boosting queue. This is so you receive new boosting contracts as your old ones age out. Only do this if you actively plan to go boosting within the next IRL hour.
2. Pickup a boosting contract of your choice.
3. Optionally, start a boosting group by clicking the group icon next to the start contract button.
   1. This will show a boosting contract ID in the top left corner, which your friends will use to request to join the boosting group.
   2. Accept up to a total of 4 people in the boosting group
4. Start the boosting contract by hitting the left most play button.
5. Find the vehicle in the red area displayed on your GPS.
6. Lockpick & Hotwire the vehicle - Be warned, the cops will get alerted!
7. Deliver the vehicle to the red car icon on your GPS for your payout.

Pro tip; Doing boosting contracts with at least 1 other person will provide addtional XP rates! Get at least 1 other friend with you to earn double XP.
