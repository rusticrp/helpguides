# Game captures

We encourage you to run a 3rd party recording/clipping software during your time in city. This will help when it comes to logging tickets, it provides visual and audio evidence to the support team. It can also help with bugs, compensation and defending yourself should a ticket be logged claiming you have done something. There are a few things you can use, we recommend the below ones. If you are a streamer then twitch clips etc can be used.
