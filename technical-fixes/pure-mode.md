# Pure Mode

Due to our anti-cheat and to protect the server and it's assets (and the hard work people have put into this) we run our server is Pure Mode 1. This will cause a prompt to come up asking you to restart the game when trying to join the server. This also means if you have any client side mods (excluding certain graphics and sound packs) you will be unable to join. You will need to reinstall or remove the client side mods.

If you do not have client side mods, you will still get prompted to restart for "Pure Mode". Here's a quick way around getting that prompt.

1. Create a Shortcut for Pure Mode
   * If you have a shortcut on your Desktop already you can copy it and rename the new one to FiveM Pure, or;
   * Alternatively, navigate to your FiveM Installation Directory (typically %localappdata%\FiveM\FiveM.app), then right click on FiveM.exe and Select "Send to > Desktop (Create Shortcut)" then rename it to FiveM Pure.&#x20;
2. Once you have created the shortcut, Right Click and select Properties.
3. Under the Shortcut tab there will be an input field labelled Target which contains the path to the exe.\
   Append -pure\_1 to the end of this string.\
   Example: C:\Users\\%username%\AppData\Local\FiveM\FiveM.app -pure\_1 (Be sure to include the space before -pure\_1).
4. Click Apply and then OK.&#x20;

If you load FiveM with that shortcut you will no longer get prompted to restart for pure mode constantly.
